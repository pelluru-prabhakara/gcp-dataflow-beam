Install the Python venv.
In any of your Cloud Shell folders, let's create a new folder called venv, install the
venv package, and activate it. Here's the code you'll need for this:
mkdir venv
cd venv
python3 -m venv beam-env
source beam-env/bin/activate
After running the commands, Python will use the dedicated environment for our
Beam program.
3. Install the apache-beam package.
To install the apache-beam package in the environment, run these commands:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel
pip install 'apache-beam[gcp]==2.34.0'
cd [your hello world python code directory]

Still in Cloud Shell, declare two environment variables, project_id and region,
as follows:
export PROJECT_ID=[YOUR PROJECT ID]
export REGION=us-central1

2. Run the Beam application as a typical Python function in the command line. Check
this out as an example:
python3 beam_helloworld.py \
--project=$PROJECT_ID \
--region=$REGION \
--runner=DirectRunner \
--temp_location=gs://$BUCKET_NAME/chapter-6/dataflow/
temp
Notice in the preceding command that we declare runner and temp_location
parameters. You can choose any GCS path in your bucket for the temp_location
parameter. For the runner, we will choose Direct Runner for now. Direct Runner means
the application will run on your local machine. In this case, Beam will run the code on the
Cloud Shell environment—or, in other words, this is not yet a Dataflow application. Later,
we will just need to change the runner to run Dataflow jobs.
If successful, the application will look like this:

The application will print out the records from the example logs. In the next steps, we will
transform and store the records in a GCS bucket. But before that, I'll summarize what
you've done so far in this section, as follows:
1. You created a very simple Beam code in Python for printing out the records from a
file that is stored in a GCS bucket.
2. You activated a Python venv and installed the apache-beam[gcp] package in
that environment.
3. You ran the Beam application using Direct Runner from the command line in
Cloud Shell.
